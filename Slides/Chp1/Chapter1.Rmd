# Chapter 1: Introduction to Derivatives


## What is a Derivative? 

* __Definition:__ a financial instrument that has a value determined by the price of something else


* An agreement where you pay $\$1$ if the price of corn is greater than $\$3$ and receive $\$1$ if the
  price of corn is less than $\$1$ is a derivative
	- This contract can be used to speculate on the price of corn or it can be used to reduce risk. It
	  is not the contract itself, but how it used, and who uses it, that determines whether or not it is
	  risk-reducing.


## An Overview of Financial Markets

The trading of a financial asset involves at least four discrete steps:

* A buyer and a sellter must locate one another and agree on a price

* The trade must be _cleared_ (the obligations of each party are specified)

* The trade must be _settled_ (the buyer and the seller must deliver the cash
  or securities necessary to satisfy their obligations in the required period
  of time)

* Ownership records are updated 

\vspace{3mm}

___NB:___ notice that well-defined property rights are an assumption of 
properly functioning capital markets.


## An Overview of Financial Markets (Continued)

* Much trading of financial claims takes place on organized exchanges. In the past, the exchange
  was solely a physical location where traders would buy and sell. Such in-person venues have 
  largely been replaced by electronic networks that provide a virtual trading venue. 

* After a trade has taken place, a __clearinghouse__ matches the buyers and sellers, keeping
  track of their obligations and payments. To facilitate these payments and to help manage 
  credit risk, a derivatives clearinghouse typically imposes itself in the transaction, becoming
  the buyer to all sellers and the seller to all buyers. 


## An Overview of Financial Markets (Continued)

* It is possible for large traders to trade many financial claims directly with a dealer bypassing
  organized exchanges. Such trading is said to occur in the __over-the-counter__ (OTC) market

* Exchange activity is public and highly regulated

* OTC trading is not easy to observe or measure and is generally less regulated

* For many categories of financial claims, the value of OTC trading is greater than the value traded
  on exchanges.


## An Overview of Financial Markets (Continued)

There are at least four different measures of a market and its activity

*  __Trading volume__. This measure counts the number of financial claims that change hands

* __Market value__. The market value is the sum of the market value of the claims that _could_ 
  be traded, without regard to whether they have traded


* __Notional value__. Notional value measure the _scale_ of a position, usually with reference
  to some underlying asset


* __Open Interest__. Open interest measures the total number of contracts for which counterparties
  have a future obligation to perform


## Derivatives Markets

The introduction of derivatives markets in a market often coincides with an increase in 
price risk in that market

* Currencies were permitted to float in 1971 when the gold standard was officially
  abandoned. The modern market in financial derivatives begain in 1972, when the 
  Chicago Mercantile Exchange started trading futures contracts on seven currencies.

* OPEC's 1973 reduction in the supply of oil was followed by high and variable 
  oil prices

* U.S. interest rates became more volatile following inflation and recessions in
  the 1970s

* The market for natural gas has been deregulated gradually since 1978, resulting in 
  a volatile market in recent years

* The deregulation of electricity began during the 1990s


## Increased Volatility ...

* Oil prices 1947-2011

* Dollar/Euro rate 1947-2011

## ... Led to New and Big Markets

* Exchange-traded derivatives

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./images/Picture7.png}

* Over-the-counter markets have also grown rapidly over this period


## Exchange Traded Contracts

Contracts proliferated in the last four decades

## The Role of Financial Markets

* Insurance companies and individual communities/families have
  traditionally helped each other to share risks

* Markets make risk-sharing more efficient
	- Diversifiable risks vanish
	- Non-diversifiable risks are reallocated to those most willing to hold it


## The Uses of Derivatives

(Some) Uses for derivative contracts

* __Risk management__. Derivatives are a tool for companies and other users to reduce risks

* __Speculation__. Derivatives can serve as investment vehicles

* __Reduce transaction costs__. Sometimes derivatives provide a lower cost way to 
  undertake a particular financial transaction

* __Regulatory arbitrage__. It is sometimes possible to circumvent regulatory restrictions,
  taxes, and accounting rules by trading derivatives


## Perspectives on Derivatives

* End users
	- Corporations
	- Investment managers
	- Investors

* Intermediaries
	- Market-makers
	- Traders


* Economic observers
	- Regulators
	- Researchers


## Financial Engineering and Security Design

* The construction of a financial product from other products

* New securities can be designed by using existing securities

* Financial engineering principles
	- Facilitate hedging of existing positions
	- Allow for creation of customized products
	- Enable understanding of complex positions
	- Render regulation less effective


## Transaction Costs and the Bid-Ask Spread

* Buying and selling a financial asset 
	- Brokers: commissions
	- Market-makers: bid-ask (offer) spread

* Example 1.1: Buy and sell 100 shares of XYZ
	- XYZ: bid $= \$49.75$, offer $= \$50$, commission $= \$15$
	- Buy: $(100 \times \$50) +  \$15 = \$5,015$
	- Sell: $(100 \times \$49.75) - \$15 = \$4,960$
	- Transaction cost: $\$5,015 - \$4,960 = \$55$


## Short-Selling

* When the price of an asset is expected to fall
	- First: borrow and sell an asset (get $\$\$$)
	- Then: buy back and return the asset (pay $\$$)
	- If price fell in the mean time: Profit $\$ = \$\$ - \$$
	- The lender must be compensated for dividends received (lease-rate)

* Example: short-sell IBM stock for 90 days

## Short-Selling (Continued)

* Why short-sell?
	- Speculation
	- Financing
	- Hedging

* Credit risk in short-selling
	- Collateral and "haircut"

* Interest received from lender on collateral
	- Scarcity decreases the interest rate
	- Repo rate in bond markets
	- Short rebate in the stock market

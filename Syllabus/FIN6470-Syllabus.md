## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course covers modern derivatives markets from the economic, institutional, and
quantitative perspectives. 


### Textbooks

There is only one _required_ textbook for this course:

* [Derivatives Markets 3rd Edition][McDonald] by Robert McDonald.

I will also use some other books for some lecture material. Some of these other books are the following:

* [Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives 9th Edition][Hull] by John Hull (sometimes called the bible of option pricing)

* [Risk Transfer][Culp] by Christopher Culp (a gem of a book with a fresh perspective)

* [The Economic Function of Futures Markets][Williams] by Jeffrey Williams (entirely mind-bending perspective)

### Methods of Teaching and Learning

This course will be taught as a graduate seminar-style course. That means that your participation is crucial. You will get out of the course
what you individually and collectively put in. 

I will use the Socratic method as much as feasible during class sections. 


### Assessment 

The grade that you will earn will be determined by your ranking in the class based on the weighted total points
accumulated. There is not a predetermined percentage of the class that will get an A or that will fail. If you all
do excellent work, you will all earn exceptional grades. The weights given to each part of the class are as follows:

* Class Preparation and Participation (10%) - Your preparation is crucial! No student can earn an A without meeting these
  requirements! 

* Homework (10%) - There will be weekly homework assignments that will consist of numerical and computational problems.

* Presentations (5%) - You will each be given the opportunity to present at least once in class. Your presentation should go for
  20 minutes (15 minutes for content, and 5 minutes for discussion and questions). You must email the professor a PDF file of your
  presentation at least two days prior to your presentation.

* Annotated Bibliography (15%) - You will complete an annotated bibliography of the various readings assigned throughout the semester. 
  This will become a valuable asset when completing your midterm and final exams. I will demonstrate how to create this document in class, 
  and resources will be uploaded to Canvas.

* Midterm Exam (30%) - The midterm will be a take-home exam. You will have two weeks to complete it. You will take it at the end of Module II.

* Final Exam (30%) - The final exam will a take-home final exam. You will have two weeks to complete it. It will cover material from Module III.


#### Slack

All class communication will take place using [Slack](https://slack.com), a messaging system that replaces email.
Students will be invited to the [Fin 6470 Slack channel](https://fin6470-usu.slack.com) prior to the first week of
class.

Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be
[downloaded from the Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads), or students may use the web client
via a desktop browser.
